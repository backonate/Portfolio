                    <p>
                        As a Co-op student at Oxygen8, I was tasked with creating wiring harnesses for their Terra HVAC systems. I designed and routed wiring
                        harnesses for over 50 HVAC systems using SolidWorks. This hands-on experience gave me deep
                        insight into the complexities of HVAC system design and manufacturing processes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work involved generating production-ready Bills of Materials (BOMs) and work instructions using excel, as well as optimizing designs
                        for efficient assembly on the production floor. Through prototyping, building, and testing, I was
                        able to cut assembly time by 2-10 hours per unit while reducing Modbus cable waste from 50% to 5%. My ability to complete tasks
                        in an efficent and timely manner led me to secure a 4 month part time contract to continue my work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to this, I updated the models and drawings of the TERRA control boxes, as well as their BOMs,
                        for units ranging from T06 to T24 to reflect the realities of production. This was critical, because if the models don't
                        match what assemblers build, then hole patterns, harness lengths, BOMs, and work instructions won't match either.
                        Previously, assemblers relied on experience alone to create these control boxes. Now, with proper work instructions,
                        new hires won't need to rely on others for guidance, purchasing can order the right parts in the right quantities,
                        and overall build time is reduced while first-pass yield improves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also created wire diagrams and 3D models for all wiring BOMs. In my first week, I asked production what their biggest issue was,
                        and they identified recurring errors in placing wires into quick connects. With the addition of work instructions and diagrams,
                        assembly is now clear and consistent, eliminating rework due to miswiring and saving both time and materials on the floor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I designed over 10 pre-wired standardized fans using SolidWorks. This not only helped the production floor
                        assembly units faster but also gives a standard guideline for fans that all interns after me will use to generate
                        wiring harnesses for the other HVAC product lines.
